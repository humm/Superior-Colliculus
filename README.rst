**Abstract**: The superior colliculus (SC) is a brain- stem structure at the
 crossroad of multiple func- tional pathways. Several neurophysiological stud-
 ies suggest that the population of active neurons in the SC encodes the
 location of a visual target to foveate, pursue or attend to. Although
 extensive research has been carried out on computational modeling, most of the
 reported models are often based on complex mechanisms and explain a lim- ited
 number of experimental results. This suggests that a key aspect may have been
 overlooked in the design of previous computational models. Af- ter a careful
 study of the literature, we hypothe- sized that the representation of the
 whole retinal stimulus (not only its center) might play an impor- tant role in
 the dynamics of SC activity. To test this hypothesis, we designed a model of
 the SC which is built upon three well accepted principles: the log-polar
 representation of the visual field onto the SC, the interplay between a center
 excitation and a surround inhibition and a simple neuronal dynamics, like the
 one proposed by the dynamic neural field theory. Results show that the retino-
 topic organization of the collicular activity conveys an implicit computation
 that deeply impacts the target selection process.
